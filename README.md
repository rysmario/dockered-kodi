# dockered-kodi

I saw calibre-docker and kodi docker and thought: wouldn't it be nice to have Kodi in the web - just to manage my library?


So more or less merged it together.

Just docker build . and use the container

I recommend to mount  to /config to have your config available (copy advancedsettings etc over from existig) -> done



If you like it, great!
